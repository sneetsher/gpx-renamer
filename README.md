# gpx-renamer

File renamer for GPX traces


### Description

Small script to parse and rename GPX file based on its data like start date, recorded length, GPS bound coordinates, towns passed through (using offline reverse-geocode module).

### Why?

- When using multiple recording devices, each has its own trace naming convension. Seems more effective to keep file in chronical order. Ex: `YYYYMMDD` is sortable better than other date formats.
- Categorize GPX based on covered location (city, town, geocode) in automated way.
- Easier to tag when uploading to Open Street Map OSM.
